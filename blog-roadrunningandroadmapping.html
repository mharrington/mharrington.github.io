				<p>It's been a pretty busy start to 2015 and to date most of my time has been taken up by road mapping and road running. I'm pleased with how my running has gone so far this year. My first Parkrun was sub 21mins. It would appear that I hadn't eaten or drunk quite as much as I thought I had over Christmas. I've also claimed back my lunch hour and am managing to get out a few times a week. I'm starting to get in to a good routine like I was before the marathon. At the same time i've been working on a product roadmap for the first time. It's been a challenge but a good start to 2015.</p>
				<p>My first big run this year was the London Winter run on 1st Feb. It was good. While I didn't set a pb or the world on fire, I did run with my friend who improved his 10km time and met up with colleagues afterwards. Five of us ran from work and we raised money in aid of Cancer Research and although it was an early start I can't think of another way I would have rather spent my Sunday morning.</p>
				<p>This week I also got told that I have a place in the Great North Run. I say told, the money was taken from my account. Anyhow, I'm really excited and I can't wait. It was top of my list after the London Marathon and I'm just really lucky that I got in via the ballot at the first attempt. I'm not expecting to be running any PBs at the race. I'm just looking forward to enjoying it and soaking up the atmosphere. I've heard it is amazing.</p>
				<p>For now though it is back to the training and road mapping. If I could be as strict with my running as I am with my planning at work then my targets this year are up for grabs. As it is, I need to get training. Southend Half seems a long way off but it really isn't.</p>
