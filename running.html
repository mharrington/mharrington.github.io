				<p>I've been running since about 2009. I started running to lose wait and then got the bug. After running for a year or so I transitioned to barefoot and haven't looked back since.</p>
				<p>I gave barefoot running a chance after reading <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Born-Run-hidden-ultra-runners-greatest-ebook/dp/B004CFBMRY/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1419696090&sr=8-1&keywords=born+to+run" class="inlinelink">Born to Run</a> by Christopher McDougall. I read that book and was taken in by the whole idea and just had to give it a go. I purchased a pair of Vibram KSOs from Ebay, went out for a run around the block and was hooked. Since then i've run 5kms, 10kms, half marathons, marathons and off-road races. Running barefoot just makes me happy. </p>
				<p>I now run regularly and wouldn't have it any other way. Below are my pbs across the different distances I have run.</p>
