			<h1>2015 targets and lies</h1>

				<p>So this might be a little early to be predicting how my running will go in 2015. However, I wanted to put my targets somewhere early so I am honest with myself. When setting targets for my running I find that I lie. I tend to change or reconsider what my target was after my run depending how it has gone. Now, you might thing this might mean I always say "Ah, I wasn't really aiming for a PB". But it's not always like that. I also shift my targets when I do better than planned. For example "Ah, why didn't I push a little harder to break X minutes" rather than being "Woop! I've met my target". So this year i'm putting them somewhere public so I can look back and really see how i've done.</p>
				<p>Below are my current best times</p>
				<table>
					<th colspan="3">Personal bests</th>
						<tr>
							<td class="center">Course</td>
							<td class="center">Distance</td>
							<td class="center">Time</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td >Southend Parkrun</td>
							<td>5km</td>
							<td>19:01</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>Southend</td>
							<td>10km</td>
							<td>40:03</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>Southend</td>
							<td>Half marathon</td>
							<td>1:52:03</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>London</td>
							<td>Marathon</td>
							<td>3:58</td>
						</tr>
				</table>
				<p>I'm definitely not running another marathon this year, so I wont be improving that time, but I would like to improve all my others. So with that in mind, my targets for 2015 are:</p>
				<table>
					<th colspan="2">2015 targets</th>
						<tr>
							<td class="center">Distance</td>
							<td class="center">Time</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>5km</td>
							<td>18:30 and below</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>10km</td>
							<td>39:00 and below</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>Half marathon</td>
							<td>1:30:00 and below</td>
						</tr>
				</table>
				<p>The biggest stretch is definitely for my half marathon time. Taking 22 minutes off my pb seems huge now, but after nearly getting sub 40 for 10km this year I think I can do it. Anyway, now it's written down, at least I can't go changing my mind!</p>
