			<p class="copy">Hello and welcome to my site. I'm Matt Harrington. I'm an Associate Product Manager at Government Digital Service (GDS). I've created my own site partly out of guilt but mostly out of interest.</p>
			<br>
			<p class="copy"><em>Guilt</em> because I work in a digital team, building digital products and I had never built my own website.</p>
			<br>
			<p class="copy"><em>Interest</em> because before joining GDS I knew very little about digital products or code. Soon after joining I put together a site using a drag and drop interface but quickly lost interest. It didn't seem anything like what the developers did. In November 2014 I was lucky enough to be in the first cohort of a code club, run by the developers at GDS. This sparked my interest in building my own site from scratch.</p>
			<br>
			<p class="copy">So please feel free to take a look around
