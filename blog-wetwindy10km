			<h1>A wet and windy 10km</h1>
				<p>Today I fell back in love with running. Since I started running about 6 years ago I have never struggled for motivation until recently. First I saw running as a way to lose weight. With the weight falling off everything was great. Then I started focusing on races. A 5km park run first. Then a 10km and then a half marathon. Going that little bit further always something to keep me motivated. Then I focused on times. Cutting a minute here and a minute there became my next thrill. Then in 2014 I got a place in the London marathon. This was my ultimate motivation. Running for a charity that meant a lot to me and targetting a sub 4 hour time. With these goals in mind I never made excuses for not going out. I ran in the morning, at lunch, in fact whenever I got a chance. But since that high in April I've struggled to get the excitment back in my running. The Southend 10km in October where I set a new PB was good, but nothing like before. </br> At least until today </br> Today I ran in the Chemlsford 10km.
