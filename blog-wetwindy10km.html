			<h1>A wet and windy 10km</h1>

				<p class="blog">Today I fell back in love with running. Since I started running about 6 years ago I have never struggled for motivation until recently. First I saw running as a way to lose weight. With the weight falling off everything was great. Then I started focusing on races. A 5km park run first. Then a 10km and then a half marathon. Going that little bit further was something to keep me motivated. Then I focused on times. Cutting a minute here and a minute there became my next thrill. Then in 2014 I got a place in the London marathon. This was my ultimate motivation. Running for a charity that meant a lot to me and targetting a sub 4 hour time. With these goals in mind I never made excuses for not going out. I ran in the morning, at lunch, in fact whenever I got a chance. But since that high in April I've struggled to get the excitment back in my running. The Southend 10km in October where I set a new PB was good, but nothing like before.</p>
				<p class="blog">At least until today.</p> 
				<p class="blog">Today I ran in the Chemlsford 10km. It reminded me that I love running for running's sake. It was cold, wet and windy. I ran the whole race in a bin bag, dodging muddy puddles and cars on the course. But it was brilliant. A PB couldn't have been further from my mind. I was running with my best friend and having an hour to chat and talk as we ran round the course was great. I also chatted with others as we passed each other. Including Pat, a 76 year old, who was trying to catch up with Kev, his 73 year old friend. The further I ran the more I enjoyed it. I just relaxed and had fun. So if you are struggling to find the motivation to go for a run and waiting for a nice day, don't bother. Go out in the rain, take a friend, get soaked and cold and have a great time. </p>
